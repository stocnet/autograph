\title{Plotting convergence diagnostics}
\usage{
\method{plot}{ag_conv}(x, ...)

\method{plot}{traces.monan}(x, ...)

}
\value{
The function shows a line plot tracing the statistics obtained at
each simulation step, as well as a density plot showing the distribution
of the statistics over the entire simulation.
}
\description{
These plotting methods are for diagnosing the convergence of
simulation-based estimation procedures, such as those used in
MoNAn and ergm.
These plots are useful for identifying whether the estimation procedure
has adequately explored the state space and converged to a stable
distribution.
