\title{Plotting adequacy diagnostics}
\usage{
\method{plot}{outliers.goldfish}(x, ...)

\method{plot}{changepoints.goldfish}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class "outliers.goldfish" or "changepoints.goldfish".}

\item{...}{Additional plotting parameters, currently unused.}
}
\value{
The function shows a line plot tracing the statistics obtained at
each simulation step, as well as a density plot showing the distribution
of the statistics over the entire simulation.
}
\description{
These plotting methods are for diagnosing the adequacy of model specification,
such as those used in goldfish.
These plots are useful for identifying whether there might be significant
outliers affecting the results or significant time heterogeneity.
