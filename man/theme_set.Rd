\title{Setting a consistent theme for all plots}
\usage{
stocnet_theme(theme = NULL)

set_stocnet_theme(theme = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{theme}{String naming a theme.
By default "default".
The following themes are currently available:
default, bw, crisp, neon, iheid, ethz, uzh, rug, unibe, oxf, unige, cmu, iast, rainbow.
This string can be capitalised or not.}
}
\value{
This function sets the theme and palette(s) to be used across all
stocnet packages. The palettes are written to options and held there.
}
\description{
This function enables plots to be quickly, easily and consistently themed.
This is achieved by setting a theme option, usually at the start of an R
session, that enables the palette to be used for
all autograph-consistent plotting methods.
This includes thematic colours for backgrounds, highlights,
sequential, divergent and categorical colour schemes.
The function sets these palettes to options that are then
used by the various plotting functions.

If no theme is specified (i.e. the function is called without argument),
the current theme is reported.
The default theme is "default".
This theme uses a white background, blue and red for
highlighting, and a blue-white-red divergent palette.
The themes can be changed at any time by calling \code{stocnet_theme()}
or its alias \code{set_stocnet_theme()} with a different theme name.

Other themes include those based on the colour schemes of various
universities, including ETH Zurich, UZH, UNIBE, RUG, and Oxford.
Other themes include "bw" for black and white, "crisp" for a
high-contrast black and white theme, "neon" for a dark theme
with neon highlights, and "rainbow" for a colourful theme.
Most themes are designed to be colour-blind safe.

\section{Fonts}{

Some themes also set a preferred font for use in plots,
if available on the system (a check is performed).
In some cases, this includes a vector of options to try in sequence.
If none of the preferred fonts are available, a sans-serif font is used.
If you receive a warning about a missing font when setting a theme,
try installing one of the preferred fonts or make sure that the font is
available to R using \code{extrafont::font_import()} and \code{extrafont::loadfont()}
