  - title: "Plotting methods"
    desc: |
      Functions for graphing networks and plotting results.
      `graphr()` graphs any manynet-compatible class object automagically.
      `graphs()` and `grapht()` do the same for multiple networks
      and dynamic networks, respectively.
      `plot()` methods exist for results and other objects for stocnet packages.

  - title: "Layouts"
    desc: |
      Functions for laying out the nodes in a graph.
      Included here are some improved or additional layouts to those offered
      in `{igraph}` and `{ggraph}` by default.
