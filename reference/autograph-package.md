# autograph: Automatic Plotting of Many Graphs

Visual exploration and presentation of networks should not be difficult.
This package includes functions for plotting networks and
network-related metrics with sensible and pretty defaults. It includes
'ggplot2'-based plot methods for many popular network package classes.
It also includes some novel layout algorithms, and options for
straightforward, consistent themes.
