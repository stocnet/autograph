## About the package

This package aims to make exploration, analysis, and publication of
results from any of the stocnet packages easier, faster, and more
consistent. It does this by letting you simply set a theme, say for your
institution, and then those palettes will be used whenever you use
`plot()` or `graphr()` on an object created in one of the relevant
packages.

## Setting a theme

It is very easy to set a theme. Just type `stocnet_theme()` to see which
is the theme currently set, and to get a list of available themes. Then
enter the chosen theme name in the function to set it. All plots created
using `{autograph}` functions will then use this theme, until you change
it again.

``` r
library(autograph)
#> Registered S3 method overwritten by 'autograph':
#>   method         from
#>   plot.mcmc.list coda
library(patchwork)
stocnet_theme()
(plot(node_degree(ison_karateka)) + 
plot(tie_betweenness(ison_karateka)))/
(plot(node_in_regular(ison_southern_women, "e")) + 
plot(as_matrix(ison_southern_women),
     membership = node_in_regular(ison_southern_women, "e")))
```

``` r
stocnet_theme("ethz")
(plot(node_degree(ison_karateka)) + 
plot(tie_betweenness(ison_karateka)))/
(plot(node_in_regular(ison_southern_women, "e")) + 
plot(as_matrix(ison_southern_women),
     membership = node_in_regular(ison_southern_women, "e")))
```

## Mapping

`{autograph}` includes three one-line graphing functions with sensible
defaults based on the network’s properties.

### graphr

First, `graphr()` is used to graph networks in any of the `{manynet}`
formats. It includes sensible defaults so that researchers can view
their network’s structure or distribution quickly with a minimum of
fuss. Compare the output from `{autograph}` with a similar default from
`{igraph}`:

<img src="https://www.jameshollway.com/post/manynet/README-layout-comparison-1.png" alt="Example illustrating differences in default igraph and autograph graphs"/>

Here the `{autograph}` function recognises that the network is a
two-mode network and uses a bipartite layout by default, and recognises
that the network contains names for the nodes and prints them vertically
so that they are legible in this layout. Other ‘clever’ features include
automatic node sizing and more. By contrast, `{igraph}` requires the
bipartite layout to be specified, has cumbersome node size defaults for
all but the smallest graphs, and labels also very often need resizing
and adjustment to avoid overlap. All of `{autograph}`’s adjustments can
be overridden, however…

#### More options

Changing the size and colors of nodes and ties is as easy as specifying
the function’s relevant argument with a replacement, or indicating from
which attribute it should inherit this information.

#### More layouts

`{autograph}` can use all the layout algorithms offered by packages such
as `{igraph}`, `{ggraph}`, and `{graphlayouts}`, and offers some
additional layout algorithms for snapping layouts to a grid, visualising
partitions horizontally, vertically, or concentrically, or conforming to
configurational coordinates.

### graphs

Second, `graphs()` is used to graph multiple networks together, which
can be useful for ego networks or network panels. `{patchwork}` is used
to help arrange individual plots together.

### grapht

Third, `grapht()` is used to visualise dynamic networks. It uses
`{gganimate}` and `{gifski}` to create a gif that visualises network
changes over time. It really couldn’t be easier.

<!-- provide a common set of tools that can be used to import, export, create, and manipulate network data in a wide variety of formats, -->

<!-- and obtain a good first visualisation quickly. -->

<!-- This can be useful for pedagogical purposes, initial description, or checking something part way through the modelling process. -->

<!-- Through the most comprehensive network class-coercion available, -->

<!-- users can access routines not available in their chosen package or even in `{manynet}`. -->

<!-- `{manynet}` provides a common set of tools and a standard syntax for analysing many different types of networks. -->

<!-- It offers a broad range of functions to make, manipulate, map, measure, and model: -->

<!-- - one-, two-, and sometimes three-mode networks -->

<!-- - undirected, directed, and sometimes complex networks -->

<!-- - unweighted, weighted, and sometimes signed networks -->

## Installation

### Stable

The easiest way to install the latest stable version of `{autograph}` is
via CRAN. Simply open the R console and enter:

`install.packages('autograph')`

`library(autograph)` will then load the package and make the data and
tutorials (see below) contained within the package available.

### Development

For the latest development version, for slightly earlier access to new
features or for testing, you may wish to download and install the
binaries from Github or install from source locally. The latest binary
releases for all major OSes – Windows, Mac, and Linux – can be found
[here](https://github.com/stocnet/autograph/releases/latest). Download
the appropriate binary for your operating system, and install using an
adapted version of the following commands:

- For Windows:
  `install.packages("~/Downloads/autograph_winOS.zip", repos = NULL)`
- For Mac:
  `install.packages("~/Downloads/autograph_macOS.tgz", repos = NULL)`
- For Unix:
  `install.packages("~/Downloads/autograph_linuxOS.tar.gz", repos = NULL)`

To install from source the latest main version of `{autograph}` from
Github, please install the `{remotes}` package from CRAN and then:

- For latest stable version:
  `remotes::install_github("stocnet/autograph")`
- For latest development version:
  `remotes::install_github("stocnet/autograph@develop")`

### Other sources

Those using Mac computers may also install using Macports:

`sudo port install R-autograph`

## Funding details

Development on this package has been funded by the Swiss National
Science Foundation (SNSF) [Grant Number
188976](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188976): “Power and Networks
and the Rate of Change in Institutional Complexes” (PANARCHIC).
